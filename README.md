# LogApp
The Logistics LogApp service from Hillel, a developer of monitoring systems, is designed specifically for distribution companies and delivery services.

The new request management application is used in conjunction with the web version of LogApp and is designed for drivers and couriers who deliver goods to retailers or customers.

Once installed, LogApp Web/Mobile becomes the point of contact for mobile workers and dispatchers.

It's easy to get started: create a driver in LogApp with a phone number and email, assign a driver to a facility, and log in to the app with the driver's phone number.

Try it now and get support through every stage of the job:

- View a list of assigned jobs with detailed information for each job;
- Tracking and follow-up of requests;
- Display on the map of requests and proposed route;
- receiving pop-up notifications about routes, requests and delivery progress;
- routing through third-party navigation software;
- confirmation of the fact of delivery, with the ability to leave comments and attach a photo with the client's signature, date and time of delivery;
- communication with the dispatcher to report possible problems related to the execution of the request.
- optimization for tablets for simultaneous viewing of requests in tables and on the map;
- the ability to use your mobile device as a tracker.
- and, most importantly, to contact support or customer service via chat
